إِنَّهُمْ فِتْيَةٌ آمَنُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ وَزِدْنَاهُمْ هُدًى
<br></strong>
  innahum fityatun amanoo birabbihim wazidnahum hudan

Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.
<br>
<strong>(Surah Al-Kahf, Quran 18:13) .</strong>
<br>
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
    My dear brothers and sisters, youth, elders- the <strong>Prophet (pbuh)</strong> was once sitting with his most beloved companions, <strong>Abu Bakr and Omar and Ali and ‘Uthman.</strong> And he said,
   
أَلَسْنَا خْوَانَكَ –</strong> “Are we not your brothers?“

And the Prophet (pbuh) replied,<strong>أَنْتُمْ أَصْحَابِي وَلَكِنْ إِخْوَانِي الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِي وَلَمْ يَرَوْنِي –  </strong> – “You are my companions, but my brothers are the ones that will come after me and they will believe in me, even though they have not seen me.”</p>


<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">Those are my brothers. So that’s us that he’s talking about. That’s us. We are the brothers and sisters of the <strong>Prophet (pbuh)</strong> that he wants to see. <strong>SubhanAllah</strong>. He wants to see us bring about good. He wants to see us in Jannah. He wants to see us on the Day of Judgment, as a part of his nation, as a part of his Ummah. Today I would like to talk about one segment of this ummah that is on everyone’s minds and that is our youth, our young people.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;"> I remember growing up in Houston, Texas and we would hear khutbah after khutbah about how the youth are misguided. The youth have no direction. We need to guide the youth. And honestly, it was depressing to hear that, “oh, the youth are misguided.” It’s actually pretty depressing to hear that every Jummah after Jummah, Friday after Friday.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">

If we look at <strong>Ismail (as)</strong>, he was a teenager and his father came to him and said, <strong>“Allah says</strong> I have to sacrifice you.” And what did he say? He said, “if <strong>Allah </strong>is telling you this, O Father, then go ahead. Do what you have to do.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
سَتَجِدُنِي إِن شَاءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّابِرِينَ</strong>
<br>
<br>
You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast.”

<strong>(Surah As-Saffat, Quran 37:102)</strong>

you will find me patient. I will be patient. I will do what needs to be done.”
    
  </p> 
  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">Allah tells us, “Did you think that you would say you believe and you would not be tested?” Yes. There will be a test, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Allah promises us in Surah Ash-Sharh, Quran 94:5 – <strong>فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا</strong> – that with every hardship, with every difficulty there comes ease. It’s one of the only verses that is recited twice in a row. <strong>إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا</strong> – remember that with difficulty there comes ease.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">If you look at the example of <strong>Maryam (as)</strong> – she had to confront her people with a baby. Everyone wondered, Where did this child come from? And she had to face them all by herself. Everyone had turned away from her. She was accused of wrongdoing, and yet she had to bring this child forward. <strong>SubhanAllah</strong>, can you imagine what she must have felt? “Through those nine months, what will happen to me? What will the people say?” But Allah told her to take a vow of silence, and she placed her trust in Allah. And then, the baby <strong>Isa (as)</strong> spoke. <strong>SubhanAllah</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">All these examples in the Quran highlight <strong>young people</strong>. Young people are our greatest resource. I don’t think anyone doubts this, but it’s crucial that we emphasize their role, maintain positivity, optimism, and give them as many opportunities as they need. We must work together to support them.</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;"><strong><em>عِبَادَ اللّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ وَإِيتَاءِ ذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَيَنْهَىٰ عَنِ الْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ وَالْبَغْيِ يَعِظُكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;"><em><strong>Servants of Allah.</strong></em> Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;"><strong><em>اُذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ الْعَظِيمَ يَذْكُرْكُمْ واشْكُرُوهُ يَزِدْكُمْ واسْتَغْفِرُوهُ يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ واتّقُوهُ يَجْعَلْ لَكُمْ مِنْ أَمْرِكُمْ مَخْرَجًا</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;"><strong><em>وَأَقِمِ الصّلَاة</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">Remember Allah, the Great – He will remember you. Thank Him for His favors – He will increase you therein. And seek forgiveness from Him – He will forgive you. And be conscious of Him – He will provide you a way out of difficult matters.<br>
